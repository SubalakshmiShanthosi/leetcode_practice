# Rotation Count in a Rotated Sorted array
Given an array arr[] having distinct numbers sorted in increasing order and the array has been right rotated (i.e, the last element will be cyclically shifted to the starting position of the array) k number of times, the task is to find the value of k.

```rb
Example:
Input: arr[] = {15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12}
Output: 2
Explanation: Initial array must be {2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18}. 
We get the given array after rotating the initial array twice.


Input: arr[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 5}
Output: 4


Input: arr[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 15};
Output: 0
