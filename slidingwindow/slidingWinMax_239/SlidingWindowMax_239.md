# 239. Sliding Window Maximum
You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

```rb
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

# Approach - Maintain Double Ended Queue - 
Add element at last 
For removing Element from deque -> 
Check for maxElement condition on last of queue with current scanned element - if so removeLast from queue  
Always hold the maximum value at first of queue and remove it when the array
[windowStart] == queue(peekfirst) -- Meaning we are about to shrink the sliding window and we have to move on with next set of k elements
